My collection of iOS Shortcuts (Workflows)
==========================================
These are some Shortcuts I find useful.


Where to use them
-----------------
On Mac, iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch.

Allowing these to work
----------------------
As a safety measure, by default downloaded shortcuts won't work, so you have to turn in a setting.

1. Open "Settings"
2. Select "Shortcuts"
3. Enable "Private Sharing"

If this makes you anxious, turn it off after downloading any shortcuts. If you're *super* nervous, Shortcuts will show you what's being installed before you commit to it, so have a look to see if you think it's an evil shortcut.
